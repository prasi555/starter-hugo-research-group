## What is Bitcoin?

Bitcoin is something that has become very popular in recent years. Many of you may also have invested in bitcoin.

But have you ever wondered — what’s bitcoin all about?  Is it a fad that’s going away sometime soon?

In this video, let me attempt to answer that question for you.

## Money exchange in old times
In the olden days, people used the Barter System to transact with each other. People would exchange goods with others to receive what they considered was equivalent value goods. Some people exchanged coins, such as gold and silver. 
Then people realised that paper would be much more convenient to carry and exchange — cash came into existence. Now when you give or receive cash or transact, you need a system to record and verify those transactions. You need a place where you can 
Store information about the value you possess and the transactions you carry out. Thus banks came into existence. 

You might wonder, we already had a system where two people could exchange goods of equivalent value. But now you need the bank to act as a middleman just so that you can have some record keeping.

## The origin of Bitcoin
This is where the concept of Bitcoin was envisaged by someone (or group) called Satoshi Nakamoto. Why not have a decentralised system in which there’s no server recording transactions or no central authority? And have this completely digital.

Now, to ensure that transactions between two individuals are correctly recorded, that is, to ensure that bookkeeping is perfect, you need a system that cannot be corrupted. Let’s say person A pays 5 dollars to person B and person B pays the same 5 dollars to person C. You need to have a record of these two individual transactions but you also need to ensure that nothing is lost in transit. This means you need some form of security to “sign” each transaction at every stage in the process.

## Blockchain Technology: The building block of Bitcoin
That technology is Blockchain technology. Block chain technology ensures that there is an encrypted signature of each step in every transaction. Each signature is linked to the next, so if any signature is changed, the entire transaction is deemed invalid.
This means that no chain in the transaction can be fudged. Hence the name “block chain”. 

This way, just as every bank records transactions in a physical or electronic ledger, every transaction is saved on an “electronic block”. Just as you send money to your friend, someone else may send money to his or her friend, and so on. All these transactions are stored in blocks. When the block becomes full, another block is created. These blocks are encrypted using some kind of key or hash and then linked to the next block in the chain. So to uncover a transaction, you need to decrypt each block in the chain of blocks that is involved in that transaction. Amazing, if you think about it.

## Cryptocurrency Mining
If you’ve heard of the phrase cryptocurrency mining or crypto mining, it’s the process of decrypting the blocks. Bitcoin was used as “electronic cash” to reward the person or group or system that managed to use its resources to decrypt the block.
As there may be many transactions happening every day in different parts of the world, these chains can become extremely complex. Mining these blocks or chains then becomes an intensive operation that consumes a lot of electricity and resources. 

Okay. So you know a bit about cryptocurrency now. And maybe you want to explore it.
Just as you need a wallet to store cash, you need a cryptocurrency wallet to store cryptocurrency. Just as you have a unique account number or social security number, your wallet will have a unique address.

To transfer cryptocurrency to someone else, you need the address of the wallet of the recipient. 

If you remember, there’s no mediator such as a bank in cryptocurrency or bitcoin transactions.  So you need a system to verify this transaction.
When you initiate the transaction, the system needs to check whether you have the required amount in your cryptocurrency wallet, then it needs to check your wallet address and the recipient’s wallet address. The blockchain technology at the backend does the process of verification, and if all looks good, you have transferred bitcoin to another person with no server, bank, or central authority. 

The reward for decrypting the blocks in a transaction chain keeps coming down with time. This reduced incentive for getting a bitcoin has led to alternative coins based on the same principle.

## Why you must explore Bitcoin
How does all of this apply to you?  Inflation has been a big problem in countries across the world. In developing countries, especially, you need a hedge against inflation to ensure that your dollar today is worth close to a dollar next year!

The only problem with bitcoin is that it is quite volatile.

If you understand bitcoin and can accept the volatility, then it can be part of your investment diversification strategy. 

That, my friends, is the short story of bitcoin.
